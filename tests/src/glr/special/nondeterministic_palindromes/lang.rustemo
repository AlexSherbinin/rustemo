// Language of even length palindromes.
//
// This is a non-deterministic grammar and the language is non-ambiguous.
//
// If the string is a even length palindrome parser should reduce EMPTY at he
// middle of the string and start to reduce by A and B.
//
// LR parsing is deterministic so this grammar can't parse the input as the
// EMPTY reduction will be tried only after consuming all the input by implicit
// disambiguation strategy of favouring shifts over empty reductions.
//
// OTOH, GLR parser can handle this by forking parser at each step and trying
// both empty reductions and shifts. Only the parser that has reduced empty at
// the middle of the input will succeed.
//
// Check the same test in glr/special folder.
