These examples show how to create a custom lexer. 

In both example a sequence of
[VarInts](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints)
are parsed. The sequence is provided in file `custom_lexer.bytes` and forms
numbers: 300, 42, and 57345. You can see files with `.ast` extensions for
results of parsing.

In the example `custom_lexer_1` lexer is in charge of recognizing each VarInt
while in the example `custom_lexer_2` lexer is recognizing constituent bytes of
VarInts while the grammar defines how these bytes are organized into VarInts.

In both examples, the conversion to numeric values is done in the actions which
are generated by Rustemo and then manually edited at appropriate places to
provide the conversion.
