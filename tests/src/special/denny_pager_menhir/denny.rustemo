// This grammar has RR conflicts in LALR(1) tables

// Also, grammar shows the problem with Pager's weak compatibility test which
// doesn't work on a token level which can still case mysterious new RR
// conflicts. Pager's variant implemented in Menhir and used by Rustemo doesn't
// have this problem.
