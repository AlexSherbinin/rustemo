# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!. You can contribute
code, documentation, tests, bug reports. Every little bit helps, and credit will
always be given. If you plan to make a significant contribution it would be
great if you first announce that in the Discussions.

You can contribute in many ways:

### Types of Contributions

1.  Report Bugs

    Report bugs at <https://github.com/igordejanovic/rustemo/issues>.
    
    If you are reporting a bug, please include:
    
    -   Your operating system name and version.
    -   Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
    -   Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

2.  Fix Bugs

    Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with `bug` and
    `help wanted` is open to whoever wants to implement it.

3.  Implement Features

    Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with
    `enhancement/feature` and `help wanted` is open to whoever wants to
    implement it.

4.  Write Documentation

    Rustemo could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official
    Rustemo docs, in documentation comments, or even on the web in blog posts,
    articles, and such.
    
    Rustemo is using [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) for the
    official documentation.
